## Features

- 🎨 **1,400+ weapon skins, 20 knives with 576 finishes, 8 glove types, 63 agents, 92 music kits** — all data-driven from JSON, no datasets baked into the code.
- 🕹️ **Built-in WASD menu** — navigate with `W`/`S`, select with `E`. No external menu plugin required.
- 🔧 **Per-player customization** — custom paint seed, wear/float, name tags, and StatTrak counters via `!seed`, `!wear`, `!nametag`, and `!stattrak`.
- 🔎 **Search** — `!ws <text>` finds any skin, knife, glove, or agent without scrolling through pages.
- 🎵 **Music kits** — pick any of 92 kits from the menu, with an optional per-kit MVP counter shown on the scoreboard.
- 💾 **Persistent selections** — SQLite or MySQL, keyed by SteamID64. Selections survive reconnects, map changes, and restarts.
- 🌍 **7 languages** — per-player localization (English, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, German, French, Russian).
- 🗣️ **Agent radio voices** — agents keep their voice lines where the CS2 schema exposes the voice data.
- 🛡️ **Permission gating** — restrict individual skins, knives, gloves, agents, or the whole customization feature to admin flags.
- ⚙️ **Admin tooling** — hot reload of definitions and a diagnostics command.

## Requirements

- [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) `1.0.369` or newer (with Metamod:Source), running on `.NET 10`.
- SQLite (zero setup) or a MySQL server, selected explicitly in the config.

## Installation

1. Install [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/) and [CounterStrikeSharp](https://docs.cssharp.dev/docs/guides/getting-started.html) on your CS2 dedicated server.
2. **Required:** edit `addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/core.json` and set:

   ```json
   "FollowCS2ServerGuidelines": false
   ```

   Without this, CounterStrikeSharp blocks the item-property writes this plugin needs and **no skins will apply**.
3. Copy the plugin files using this layout:

   ```text
   addons/
     counterstrikesharp/
       plugins/
         AstraSkins/
           AstraSkins.dll
           AstraSkins.deps.json
           data/            ← weapons, knives, gloves, agents, categories JSON
           lang/            ← translations
           schema/          ← reference SQL (the plugin creates tables itself)
       gamedata/
         astra_skins.json   ← required, see Gamedata below
       configs/
         plugins/
           AstraSkins/
             AstraSkins.json
   ```

4. Configure the database in `configs/plugins/AstraSkins/AstraSkins.json` (see [Configuration](#configuration)). SQLite works out of the box; MySQL needs an existing database and user.
5. Restart the server (or `css_plugins load AstraSkins`). The startup log reports how many skins, knives, gloves, and agents were loaded.

## Commands

### Players

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `!ws` | Open the main skins menu |
| `!ws <search>` | Search every skin, knife, glove, and agent at once |
| `!knife` | Open the knife menu |
| `!gloves` | Open the gloves menu |
| `!agents` | Open the agents menu |
| `!wsrefresh` | Reapply saved selections |
| `!wsreset [all\|weapons\|knife\|gloves\|agents\|music]` | Reset saved selections, all or per category |

### Customization

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `!seed <0-1000>` | Custom paint seed for the held weapon · `!seed gloves <n>` for gloves · `!seed reset` to clear |
| `!wear <0.00-1.00>` | Custom wear/float for the held weapon · `!wear gloves <n>` for gloves · `!wear reset` to clear |
| `!nametag <text>` | Name tag for the held weapon · `!nametag reset` to remove |
| `!stattrak` | Toggle StatTrak on the held weapon · `!stattrak <count>` sets the counter · `!stattrak reset` removes it |

Overrides apply on top of the selected skin, take effect instantly, and persist in the database. They target the weapon currently held (knife included); pass `gloves` as the first argument to target equipped gloves instead. A skin must be selected for the item first.

StatTrak works the same way: enable it on a weapon or knife and the counter goes up with every kill you get with that item, persisting across reconnects and map changes.

> **Tip:** seeds only change finishes whose pattern placement varies — Case Hardened, Crimson Web, Marble Fade, Fade. Most other skins look identical on every seed.

### Admin

| Command | Default permission | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!wsreload` | `@css/config` | Reload the JSON definitions and reapply skins to everyone |
| `!wsdebug` | `@css/config` | Diagnostics: load counts, database mode, and the caller's selections |

Both can be disabled entirely in the config.

## Menu Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `W` / `S` | Move up / down |
| `E` | Select |
| `Shift` | Back |
| `R` | Close |

The menu items are numbered as a visual guide for orientation; navigation is by keys, not numbers. While the menu is open the player is held in place. Heads up: `E` still performs its normal in-world action (open doors, pick up weapons, defuse), so avoid confirming a selection while standing on the bomb.

## Search

With 1,449 weapon skins alone, scrolling is not always the fastest way in. `!ws <search>` opens a flat result list spanning weapon skins, knife finishes, glove finishes, and agents.

Every whitespace-separated term has to appear in the entry, so you can narrow down quickly:

```text
!ws redline        → Redline on every weapon that has it
!ws ak redline     → straight to the AK-47 Redline
!ws marble fade    → every Marble Fade knife
!ws ct mccoy       → the CT agent
```

Results respect permissions and are capped at 64 entries; already-equipped items are marked with `*`.

## Music Kits

The main menu has a **Music Kit** category with every selectable kit and a "Default Music Kit" entry to go back to the stock music. The selected kit plays at the usual cues (round start, MVP anthem, bomb planted) and persists like any other selection.

With `EnableMusicKitMvpCounter` set to `true`, the plugin also tracks how many MVPs each player earns with their selected kit and shows the count on the MVP scoreboard panel, like StatTrak music kits in the official game. The counter persists in the database and is cleared by `!wsreset music` or a full reset.

If `data/music_kits.json` is missing, the category simply stays hidden.

## Configuration

`configs/plugins/AstraSkins/AstraSkins.json` — the defaults are safe to publish and use placeholder credentials:

```json
{
  "ConfigVersion": 1,
  "DatabaseMode": "mysql",
  "Sqlite": {
    "Path": "data/astra_skins.sqlite"
  },
  "MySql": {
    "Host": "127.0.0.1",
    "Port": 3306,
    "Database": "astra_skins",
    "Username": "astra_skins",
    "Password": "change-me",
    "SslMode": "required"
  },
  "Menu": {
    "ItemsPerPage": 6,
    "TimeoutSeconds": 25,
    "CooldownMilliseconds": 180,
    "SelectionCooldownMilliseconds": 900,
    "AllowWhileDead": true
  },
  "Customization": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "Permission": "",
    "MaxNameTagLength": 20
  },
  "ApplyPlayerCosmeticsOnBotTakeover": false,
  "EnableMusicKitMvpCounter": false,
  "Definitions": {
    "Weapons": "data/weapons.json",
    "Knives": "data/knives.json",
    "Gloves": "data/gloves.json",
    "Agents": "data/agents.json",
    "MusicKits": "data/music_kits.json",
    "Categories": "data/categories.json"
  },
  "EnableAdminReloadCommand": true,
  "AdminReloadPermission": "@css/config",
  "EnableAdminDebugCommand": true,
  "AdminDebugPermission": "@css/config"
}
```

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `DatabaseMode` | `"sqlite"` or `"mysql"` — required, validated at startup |
| `Menu.ItemsPerPage` | Visible menu rows (3–6) |
| `Menu.TimeoutSeconds` | Menu auto-closes after this many idle seconds |
| `Menu.CooldownMilliseconds` | Minimum delay between menu key presses |
| `Menu.SelectionCooldownMilliseconds` | Minimum delay between skin selections |
| `Menu.AllowWhileDead` | Allow opening the menu while dead |
| `Customization.Enabled` | Master switch for `!seed` / `!wear` / `!nametag` |
| `Customization.Permission` | Restrict customization to a flag; empty = everyone |
| `Customization.MaxNameTagLength` | Name tag cap, 4–32 (default 20 matches the real game) |
| `ApplyPlayerCosmeticsOnBotTakeover` | Apply the human player's cosmetics to the possessed bot pawn; off by default to preserve bot loadouts |
| `EnableMusicKitMvpCounter` | Track per-player MVP counts for selected music kits |

### SQLite

```json
{ "DatabaseMode": "sqlite", "Sqlite": { "Path": "data/astra_skins.sqlite" } }
```

The plugin creates the schema on startup — nothing to install. Note the default path lives inside the plugin folder: **back up the `.sqlite` file before redeploying the plugin directory**, or point `Path` somewhere outside it.

### MySQL

```json
{ "DatabaseMode": "mysql", "MySql": { "Host": "…", "Port": 3306, "Database": "astra_skins", "Username": "astra_skins", "Password": "…", "SslMode": "required" } }
```

The database and user must already exist; the plugin creates its table on startup. `SslMode` accepts `none`, `preferred`, `required` (default), `verifyca`, or `verifyfull` — keep `required` for remote databases so credentials travel encrypted; use `preferred` or `none` only if your MySQL server has TLS disabled.

## Localization

Every player-facing message and menu label is localized per player through CounterStrikeSharp's language system. Players pick their language with `css_lang <language>` (e.g. `css_lang es`); missing translations fall back to the server language.

Shipped: `en` English · `es` Spanish · `zh` Chinese (Simplified) · `pt` Portuguese · `de` German · `fr` French · `ru` Russian — flat key/value JSON files in `lang/`.

Wrong or missing translation? PRs welcome — edit the matching `lang/*.json`. To add a language, copy `en.json` to `<culture>.json` and translate the values.

## Cosmetic Data

All cosmetic content lives in `data/*.json` and is validated at startup and on `!wsreload` — malformed JSON, duplicate IDs, unknown weapon entities, missing fields, and broken category references are skipped with clear log messages.

Currently packaged:

| Type | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Weapons | 34 |
| Weapon skins | 1,449 |
| Knives | 20 |
| Knife skins | 576 |
| Glove types | 8 |
| Glove skins | 94 |
| Agents | 63 |
| Music kits | 92 |

To regenerate the data after a CS2 update, run the included generator — it pulls the latest `items_game.txt` and translation data automatically:

```bash
python tools/generate_definitions.py --output data
```

## Gamedata

Copy `gamedata/astra_skins.json` to `addons/counterstrikesharp/gamedata/`. It contains the single memory signature used to apply paint attributes visually.

CS2 updates can break this signature. When that happens the plugin keeps running and logs a clear error instead of crashing — update the signature (or grab an updated release) to restore skin rendering.

## Building from Source

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

Requires the .NET 10 SDK. Deployable output lands in `bin/Release/net10.0/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Skins never apply, no errors | Set `FollowCS2ServerGuidelines: false` in `configs/core.json` and restart |
| "gamedata signature is missing" in logs | Copy `gamedata/astra_skins.json` to `addons/counterstrikesharp/gamedata/` |
| Skins stopped working after a CS2 update | The gamedata signature broke — see [Gamedata](#gamedata) |
| `!wsreload` / `!wsdebug` say no permission | Add your SteamID to `configs/admins.json` with the `@css/config` flag |
| `!seed` looks like it does nothing | The held skin's pattern doesn't vary by seed — try Case Hardened or Crimson Web |

## Disclaimer

Server-side skin plugins conflict with Valve's [server guidelines](https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/server_guidelines/). Running this on a public server with a GSLT carries a token-ban risk that you accept as the operator. Use at your own discretion.
